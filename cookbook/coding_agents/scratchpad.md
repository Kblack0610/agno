# Coding Agents Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
We need to implement coding agents for continuous testing and validation in the Agno framework. These agents will monitor code changes, run tests, perform code quality checks, and provide feedback to developers. We're also creating a comprehensive coder bot that can leverage all available coding tools.

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. [X] Create a code testing agent that can run tests, lint code, and check typing
2. [X] Implement a file system monitor to detect code changes
3. [X] Build a code review agent for deeper analysis
4. [X] Develop a comprehensive coder bot that integrates multiple development tools
5. [X] Create validation tests with validation steps between each test
6. [ ] Implement sequential thinking integration for advanced validation
7. [ ] Add configuration options for customizing validation workflows
8. [ ] Create documentation and examples

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- [X] Set up initial project structure
- [X] Implemented code testing agent
- [X] Created file system monitor
- [X] Developed code review agent 
- [X] Created documentation
- [X] Built comprehensive coder bot with multiple tools
- [X] Created tests with validation steps
- [X] Successfully ran all validation tests
- [ ] Integrated with sequential thinking MCP
- [ ] Added configuration system

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Need to validate each component works correctly 
- Must implement tests for coder bot functionality 
- Need to integrate with sequential thinking MCP for advanced reasoning
- Should create examples demonstrating the workflow

## Next Steps and Action Items
1. Implement configuration system for the validation bot
2. Complete integration with sequential thinking MCP
3. Create additional specialized validation agents (code quality, performance)
4. Create example projects demonstrating the entire workflow

## Lessons
- Agno provides a flexible framework for building agents
- Sequential thinking MCP can be used for step-by-step reasoning
- We should leverage existing tools rather than reinventing functionality
- Tests should validate each step in the process
- Mock implementations can be used for testing when real dependencies are unavailable
- Using triple-quoted strings in Python requires careful handling of escape sequences
