# Coding Agents Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
We need to implement coding agents for continuous testing and validation in the Agno framework. These agents will monitor code changes, run tests, perform code quality checks, and provide feedback to developers.

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Create a code testing agent that can run tests, lint code, and check typing
2. Implement a file system monitor to detect code changes
3. Build a code review agent for deeper analysis
4. Set up a notification system for reporting issues
5. Integrate with existing development workflows

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- [X] Set up project structure
- [X] Implement code testing agent
- [X] Create file system monitor
- [X] Develop code review agent
- [X] Write documentation
- [X] Create example workflow
- [ ] Build notification system (can be added in future)
- [ ] Add more configuration options (can be extended)

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Need to handle different test frameworks
- Must balance performance with thoroughness
- Should provide actionable feedback
- Need to avoid false positives
- Must integrate with existing development workflows

## Next Steps and Action Items
1. Create basic project structure
2. Implement code testing agent with pytest, flake8, and mypy integration
3. Build file system monitor with watchdog
4. Test basic functionality

## Lessons
- Study the existing Agno agents for best practices
- Use the right tools for each testing task
- Ensure clear, actionable feedback
