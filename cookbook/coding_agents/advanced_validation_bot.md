# Continuous Prompt-Based Validation Bot

## Background and Motivation
We need to create a comprehensive continuous validation bot in the Agno framework that can run tests, perform validation, and execute workflows based on prompts. This bot will leverage the sequential thinking MCP for reasoning and problem-solving while providing specialized validation capabilities tailored to different aspects of code quality and testing.

## Revised High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Sequential Thinking MCP Integration**
   - Leverage the existing MCP for step-by-step reasoning
   - Create validation-specific thought templates
   - Build workflow orchestration on top of sequential thinking

2. **Specialized Validation Agents**
   - Test validation agent (unit, integration, end-to-end)
   - Code quality agent (linting, typing, complexity)
   - Performance testing agent
   - Security validation agent

3. **Core Validation Engine**
   - Create validation primitives (test runners, linters, etc.)
   - Build prompt-based validation orchestration
   - Implement validation state management
   - Create validation reporting system

4. **Integration with Development Tools**
   - Connect with Playwright for web interaction
   - Integrate with different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Support for code analysis tools
   - Version control integration

5. **Configuration and Extensibility**
   - Create flexible configuration system
   - Support plugin architecture
   - Allow custom validation rules
   - Enable workflow customization
