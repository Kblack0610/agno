## Current Task: Fix Python Calculator Application

### Task Description
Fix the calculator code generation so it works reliably when run through the CLI tool with continuous validation.

### Progress
[X] Identify the root cause of the "cannot import name 'add' from 'utils'" error
[X] Modify main.py to include utility functions directly (self-contained approach)
[X] Update test_main.py to work with the new structure
[X] Verify tests pass locally
[X] Document the solution and lessons learned

### Issues Encountered
- Python import errors when running from different contexts (CLI vs direct execution)
- Tests failing when run via TestValidationAgent but passing when run directly

### Solution
Made the application self-contained by including all utility functions directly in main.py rather than importing from utils.py.

## Lessons Learned

### Python Module Import Context
- **Root Cause**: Python's import resolution depends on execution context (working directory, PYTHONPATH, etc.)
- **Issue**: When code is executed from different directories via tools like cli.py, imports using relative module names can fail
- **Solution**: Either make modules self-contained or use absolute imports with careful path management

### CLI Tool Execution Environment
- The execution context for tests is different when run directly vs. via the CLI tool
- The CLI tool likely uses a different working directory and import context
- This affects how Python resolves module imports like `from utils import add`

### Best Practices
1. **Self-Contained Modules**: For portable code that might be executed from different contexts, keep functionality self-contained
2. **Explicit Path Management**: If you need imports, add directories to sys.path explicitly using absolute paths
3. **Python Package Structure**: For larger projects, use proper package structure with __init__.py files
4. **Import Error Diagnosis**: Pay attention to error details like "(unknown location)" which indicate import resolution issues

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- Different Python execution environments can behave differently with imports
- Always test code in the actual execution context it will be used in

## How to Run the Calculator Application

### Running the CLI Tool Successfully
```bash
python3 cli.py run "Create a simple Python calculator application" --workspace-dir ./output --mock-mcp --continuous-validation
```

### Running the Calculator Directly
```bash
cd /path/to/output
python main.py
```

### Running Tests Directly
```bash
cd /path/to/output
python -m unittest test_main.py
```
